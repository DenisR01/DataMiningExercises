"The Life List is a nice watch - warm, well-paced, and not overly dramatic. What stayed with me most is the message: pain and loss are part of life, but suffering is a choice. That idea isn't presented in a preachy way - it's just woven into the characters' decisions, especially as the main character starts reconnecting with what actually matters.",0.067,0.815,0.118,-0.6652
"The portrayal of the mother-daughter relationship was especially well done. It shows how grief can create distance but also bring people back together, without sugarcoating the process.",0.111,0.818,0.072,0.0378
"It's the kind of movie that makes you pause - not because it's groundbreaking, but because it reminds you of things you already knew but maybe forgot. Like how helping others can also heal something in you.",0.147,0.853,0.0,0.7227

"The Life List (2025) was surprisingly easy to sit through, even with its longer runtime. The pacing was pretty well-balanced, which helped a lot. I appreciated how the story packed in life lessons without getting preachy or feeling like it was dragging. It had this light tone that made it watchable while still trying to say something meaningful, even if it didn't always dig as deep as it could've.",0.224,0.776,0.0,0.9423
"The directing was a bit safe, and while that's not always a bad thing, I think the movie could've gone a little further with emotional depth. A lot of the focus is placed on how the main character reacts to situations, but sometimes it felt like the movie brushed past what actually mattered in the moment. The acting, though, made up for a lot of that. The leads did a solid job carrying the weight of the story. The supporting cast was hit-or-miss, but nothing that pulled me out of it.",0.142,0.858,0.0,0.901
"Visually, it looked great. The cinematography was smooth, with a nice mix of bright tones and more grounded scenes that worked well with the mood. I also really liked the music choices. The soundtrack wasn't overwhelming but it blended in perfectly, adding just enough to keep the emotional beats working. The script had its flaws, sure, but it didn't feel forced. It served the story, and even if it leaned into familiar territory, it didn't lose its charm. All in all, it's not groundbreaking, but it's a comforting watch with a decent message.",0.265,0.709,0.025,0.9762

"Even though the main point of the movie was Alex trying to complete her life list that she made when she was a teenager, it didn't feel childish whatsoever. They approached it from a mature perspective and showed what growth and change for Alex looked like.",0.189,0.811,0.0,0.8311

"After watching this film, I could say it was inspired by P. S. I Love You, but changing it to a mother's love and showing her daughter that when you walk down the road of life you can get lost, and to find yourself, you need to remember what you wanted to be. Sofia Carson acts cleanly, showing sympathy and involving you in her character; certain parts can be perfectly related to one's life, making it clear that not everything is fiction.",0.229,0.741,0.03,0.9636
"There are several lines from the film that I can take away. And although the film is predictable: love always triumphs even after death, and if a mother sees her son lost, even with her last breath she will try to advise him and make him understand that we can't settle for less. Yes, I recommend the film, so put it on your list.",0.156,0.763,0.082,0.6852
"I'm about to be offensive, but no offence, the lead actress seems like she hasn't ever lost anyone in her life, her line delivery especially the first time meeting the lawyer and saying ""I just lost my mother"" had absolutely no depth, no tears, no emotions, not even grief. No voice control, no empathy for the character shes playing. As shes watching videos from her dead mother there aren't even tears in her eyes, even as she watches the last video she seems to value looking pretty more than showing actual emotion. I really liked the male lead and all the other characters but I really wonder what happened behind the audition process that made her the lead. I could imagine so many young actresses doing a better job and making this a fantastic film. I'm not saying this as something like a hate comment, just that she really needs to think about loss and emotions and get in to the story. I often put my hand over her motionless face to at least try and focus at the story because she was just playing a pretty girl that doesn't want to get ugly. The story made me cry on multiple occasions imagining the young girls struggle yet the young girl acted like it was a vacation trip with her friend calling her on face-time not her dead mother continuously saying her last words to her from a dvd. Like she never even had her lips quiver for more than a milisecond (didn't want to be ugly, I guess, or just a bad actress) never had the horrible situation of not being able to finish a sentence, having words stuck in her throat because of grief or at least speaking like she has a lump in her throat -- actual real, raw and ugly human emotions after losing the most loved person. It made me so angry! Couldn't she at least try to take breaths before speaking? Even if we imagine that she was a cold and prideful character, we didn't even see her actually blocking the emotions that would almost come apparent. Never saw her swallowing tears, any despair, anything!! Absolutely horrible acting from someone in such a vulnerable role. Every actor should know their limits and not go for roles that they are not ready for.",0.176,0.655,0.169,0.3022
"I have always admired Sofia Carson's talent as a triple threat, and The Life List, in my opinion, should be her career-defining moment. While her music showcases her incredible voice, this film highlights her exceptional acting abilities. It delivers a beautifully crafted and emotionally resonant story of loss and grief, supported by outstanding performances from the entire cast.",0.241,0.642,0.117,0.8583
"Often, films in this genre can feel forced or fail to capture genuine emotion, leaving the viewer disengaged. However, The Life List stood out by bringing emotional depth that resonated profoundly with me. It even moved me to tears in certain moments. Sofia Carson's portrayal of Alex felt authentic and heartfelt. From her pain over her mother's passing to her relationships with her brothers, every interaction felt natural and believable. This authenticity was a refreshing departure from the contrived dynamics often found in similar films.",0.119,0.764,0.118,-0.2263
"On a personal level, the movie struck a deep emotional chord, reminding me of my own father's passing. Its themes of love, loss, and family were handled with such care that they lingered with me long after the credits rolled. The film's poignant exploration of grief and resilience was nothing short of inspiring.",0.199,0.654,0.146,0.5526

"The bond between the mother and the daughter stayed with me the most, the way a mother helps her daughter sort her life even after her death was a very good concept.

"I found it to be very predictable , but anyone who watches this movie would surely enjoy the process of it. It makes you want to have a family like what Alexandra Caroline Rose had, I would say she was really lucky to have them by her side always and she also gradually figured out their importance in the movie.",0.273,0.727,0.0,0.9649
"I liked how the brother and sister bond was shown, how they actually communicated through their emotions and how it was shown that just because your brother doesn't say anything or acts indifferent is not because he dislikes you but he might have his own insecurities or envies.",0.066,0.799,0.136,-0.5819

"I was actually enjoying this movie until I remembered, or it was pointed out by the brothers, that the mother was definitely showing favoritism towards the daughter. How could a mom of 3 make dvds with all these cute memories and life lessons for one child and leave the other 2 out?! I would be devastated to be one of her ""other"" children being left out my entire life and then again in death. She could have at least made additional videos for her sons explaining that because they have their lives together she didn't/doesn't need to support them the way she does their sister. It's just sad, and mean.",0.085,0.798,0.117,-0.6059
"I don't get why Netflix casts this actress for main roles. The movie could have been so much better if someone else was portraying Alex. It seemed to me the whole time she was trying to keep her hair unmoveable. Her face and frame is staying still in moments when she could have shown some spark. It annoys me how she is whispering her words. I didn't believe her for a second she is ""Alex"", I didn't see the character - only the actress pretending to be someone. I had the same issue with her in the other main role for Netflix - Purple hearts. Exactly the same face and hair issue, all the same ""play"", whispering and posing beautifully. I mean - she is very beautiful, no denying that.",0.167,0.814,0.019,0.9631
"The movie is good, perfectly predictable, plain and flat. You get it from the title. From the 5th minute on you know what is going to happen and almost exactly how. All of the characters you have already seen in all the other movies of the same type, no surprise whatsoever, no complexity. Worth for killing 2 hours.",0.103,0.752,0.146,-0.2453

I can't help but compare it with PS I Love You. Now they have different approaches and plot so it's hardly fair to do so but while watching this I just wish they dug deeper into it and the other movie kept popping out my mind.,0.219,0.752,0.029,0.9123
"It's not a bad movie by any means. It's soft and warm feeling when watching I did tear up in some scenes because I can relate with the deceased mother scenario so it felt more personal to me seeing a mother-daughter movie. It's very simple and predictable movie that tries to focus on character growth, familial bonding, love, career...basically life and having the better version of yourself. But that's the issue is that they skirted very lightly on these. There's just so many focus points that they never got that deep. Like for example I could hardly feel the grief coming from the siblings. They touched upon this here and there but nowhere near enough.",0.114,0.855,0.031,0.7446
The movie feels too clean like they're afraid to get dirty with touching the themes but anyway the way they went about the list is good. It felt mature and not childish. I do like the chemistry between the leads. The characters aren't perfect and kinda messy too so they do feel real and not picture perfect fiction. Overall it's good enough for a watch.,0.236,0.618,0.146,0.78
"At first I said: ""come on, let's put on a relaxing movie! It's ok!"" but minute by minute I realized that it was a different movie. The first few minutes I analyzed the graphycs, transitions and how the actors played. I said: ""It is good, so let's to relax"" This movie was made to see life of a person after the death of a loved one. I'm sure that many of you have been through this.",0.23,0.715,0.055,0.9504

Of course ending is expected but the journey is fun. Especially because the chemistry between Alex and Brad is so good that you can easy feel it from their first meeting.

"The Life List (2025) was a Netflix movie I hadn't heard about until a couple of days ago, so I gave it a watch and it was a movie when I started off liking and by the time it had ended, I loved the movie.",0.133,0.867,0.0,0.765
"Positives for The Life List (2025): Now on paper, this is a movie you've seen a million times before Sunday and it plays out the same way and it works. The movie isn't going for anything crazy or insane like other Netflix movies in the past movie, it is trying to telling a story in a competent way. Sofia Carson does a great job as the main character and she is one of those former Disney Channel Stars who has taken their time with their rise to ACE Stardom. This is her best performance since leaving Disney Channel and she was recently in Jaume Collet-Serra's Carry-on (2024) back in December and I'm a big fan of that movie. I enjoyed a lot of the side characters and their interactions with Carson. For a while, I was positive that the 2-hour runtime was going to be a problem, but to my surprise the movie wa perfectly paced. There is a good amount of comedy and drama sprinkled in the movie that felt natural and I appreciate that side of the movie. And finally, this is the type of movie I would like to Netflix do more of where there is a good amount of cheese for their fans mixed in with some realism to keep people like me entertained.",0.213,0.766,0.021,0.9933

"Alex Rose (Sofia Carson) is struggling to figure out her life. Her boyfriend is an amiable college dropout looking to finish his video game. She has been working at a safe job for her mother (Connie Britton)'s successful company. When her mother dies, she is shocked that she didn't inherit the company.

"Writer/director Adam Brooks had a few good movies back in the 2000's. Like everybody else, he's doing Netflix now. Somewhere along the way, he lost something. This movie is jamming so much into it and yet leaves me feeling so little about it. It is two hours long and it feels like it. On the positive side, I do like Sofia Carson and most of these actors. All the different story elements keep me engaged despite not being done with tension. There is too much story here and it is done like a Hallmark movie for some reason. Maybe get rid of the video game boyfriend and start the list sooner.",0.164,0.8,0.036,0.9337
